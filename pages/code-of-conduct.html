        <h2 class="h1">Code of Conduct</h2>
        <p>GitHub Universe is a community event intended for networking and collaboration in the tech community. We value the participation of each member and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout all events hosted in the GitHub space. To make clear what is expected, all attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers at any event in the GitHub space are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</p>
        <p>GitHub is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form, nor do we tolerate any behavior that would reasonably lead to another event participant being made to feel unsafe, insecure, or frightened for their physical or emotional well-being.</p>
        <p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any presentation given in the GitHub space or in any presentation associated with or related to GitHub. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate at this event.</p>
        <p>Each event guest is entirely responsible for his or her own actions.</p>
        <p>Attendees violating these rules will be asked to leave the event at the sole discretion of the event managers.</p>
        <p>Thank you for helping to make this a welcoming, friendly space for all.</p>

        <h3 class="h2">Contact Information</h3>
        <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the organizer at <a href="mailto:events@github.com">events@github.com</a>, another GitHub employee or a security officer.</p>
        <p>GitHubbers will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, escort to safety, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
