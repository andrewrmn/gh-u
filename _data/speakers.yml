  talk: Accessibility&#58; It's More Than Just Screen
  talkDescription: Roughly 1 in 5 people in America live with a disability and legal actions against inaccessible sites are becoming more and more common. It would be irresponsible to ignore the needs of all our users when developing for the web, so why don't we design accessible sites to begin with? In this talk, I'll explain the basics of web accessibility, including the guidelines you should be following, the adaptive technologies commonly in use, and help you better advocate for users with disabilities in your work.

  talk: Using GitHub's GraphQL API to Manage Open Source Projects
  talkDescription: |
    GraphQL is a legitimate way to build and consume APIs with less front end frustration. It has only been out of developer preview but truly shaking up the way front-end and mobile applications are being developed.
    Getting into open source projects can be a daunting process, and there are a lot of existing tools out there to assist in getting your first open source pull request including Code Triage, IssueHub, and of course firstpr.me. Open Sauced is one more tool to help by providing a platform to organize notes on potential projects the user has not yet contributed to by leveraging the now public GitHub GraphQL API. This talk will compare the GraphQL benefits over REST and walk through the implementation of live code implementing the open source GraphQL features using the Apollo project.

  talk: Quickly Build a Collaborative CMS Powered by the GitHub API
  talkDescription: |
    At The New York Times we have built an entire CMS in which the only stateful layer is the GitHub API. This vastly simplifies our infrastructure setup and maintenance, and gives us powerful primitives on which to build a collaborative content editing system used by writers, designers, photographers, editors, and even web developers.
    In this talk you will learn&#58; how The New York Times uses the GitHub API to store documents in the CMS's intermediate format, how we support collaborative editing via the GitHub API, how we catalog our posts via the GitHub API, how we are able to support legacy ("custom") development at the same time, and how the GitHub ecosystem, e.g. CI services empower our CMS even further.

  talk: Having an Invisible Disease at GitHub
  talkDescription: |
    Invisible diseases (mental health conditions, neurologic disease, rheumatic disease, etc.) are harder to identify, vary widely, and are often misunderstood and stigmatized. As someone with Young Onset Parkinson's Disease, I'm personally familiar with how my working conditions, the attitudes of my colleagues, and my ability to disclose has affected the course of my disease.
    The theme of this talk is about how an empathetic, positive, and flexible work atmosphere is beneficial for people living with chronic disease, based on my personal account. Being productive and thriving at GitHub despite having Young Onset Parkinson's Disease has largely depended on working with empathetic people, but also the ability to work remotely, flexibility, and ultimately feel supported enough to disclose to those I work with. Companies can foster an atmosphere of trust that allows those dealing with chronic illness to self care, whether they choose to disclose or not.

  talk: Caring For Your Felling Developers
  talkDescription: |
    “Move Fast & Break Things”, “Get Shit Done”, “Disrupt”. These are mantras of the tech and design industry. They praise speed and hard work but overlook a core element&#58; people. When building software, we devote hundreds of hours to planning, organizing, building, and launching, but we often only spend a very small fraction of that same time thinking about the people responsible for those activities.
    Soft skills and emotional intelligence are critical components to building great software. In general, I have found technical audiences do not get as much exposure to these topics as they should. Understanding each other and knowing practical ways to keep each other motivated and encouraged will help us go beyond what our individual technical skills can accomplish.
    Let's talk about how we can proactively care for our team with the same passion we use when caring for our software. We’ll explore practical ways to change how we engage with each other to help us build a more supportive working environment and also deliver better products, faster.
